Linkdr is where the people hire software developers. Like in real life, but better.

## The App

In this day and age where technology is prevalent, tech companies everywhere are hiring. For tech recruiters who are scuttling around trying to match relevant candidates to their available jobs, they simply have no time to go through bloated resumes. 

Our app targets to streamline the hiring process for tech companies or recruiters, only asking for relevant details from candidates. No more wordy cover letters which no one bothers to read anyway or repeated details being asked! 

### How It Works

- Tech recruiters or companies will be able to:
  - Post job listings
  - Shown relevant candidates for respective listings
  - Reach out to candidates after you get LINKD via our in-app chat system or by direct email
  
- Candidates will be able:
  - View relevant job listings
  - Express interest in jobs
  - Sit back and wait for companies to approach!
